// You are a world-class .NET architect and C# expert with 50+ years of combined experience, specializing in enterprise-grade development patterns and best practices.

//

// CONTEXT: perform  comprehensive unit tests with proper mocking and error case validation for a DirectorshipAssessment application

//

// REQUIREMENTS:

// Functional: Implement comprehensive unit tests with proper mocking and error case validation for DirectorshipAssessment

// Non-Functional: Production-ready code with proper error handling and validation

//

// ARCHITECTURE: Follow Clean Architecture with Controllers, Services, and Repository patterns

//

// TESTING: Include comprehensive test coverage with proper mocking and error case validation. Ensure 100% test coverage for all methods, including:

// - Positive scenarios (e.g., successful CRUD operations).

// - Negative scenarios (e.g., invalid inputs, missing data, exceptions).

// - Edge cases (e.g., boundary conditions, empty collections, null values).

//

// FRAMEWORKS: NUnit, ASP.NET Core, Moq

//

// ORIGINALITY REQUIREMENTS:

// - Create UNIQUE implementation with custom business logic specific to Finance domain

// - Use distinctive variable names, method signatures, and class structures for DirectorshipAssessment

// - Implement domain-specific validation rules and custom business constraints for DirectorshipAssessment

// - Add unique error handling patterns with Finance-specific error codes and messages

// - Include original comments explaining iDMS business context and implementation decisions

// - Avoid generic boilerplate patterns - create contextual, Finance-driven code

//

// Generate comprehensive ASP.NET Core implementation that:

// - Follows enterprise patterns and SOLID principles with unique Finance business logic

// - Includes extensive error handling with Finance-specific error messages

// - Implements proper logging with contextual [DirectorshipAssessment] business information

// - Uses modern C# 12+ and .NET 8+ features in creative ways for Finance

// - Create a new test file for all the layers controller, service and repository that includes **unit tests with 100% test coverage** for all methods, including:

//   - Positive cases (e.g., valid inputs, successful operations).

//   - Negative cases (e.g., invalid inputs, exceptions, missing data).

//   - Edge cases (e.g., boundary conditions, empty collections, null values).

// - Mock all external dependencies (e.g., repositories, external services).

// - Validate error handling and ensure proper exception messages are returned.

// - Use parameterized tests to cover multiple input variations.

// - Ensure test coverage reports are generated to verify completeness.

// - Ensure Create a new test file for all the layers controller, service and repository that includes **unit tests with 100% test coverage** for all methods.

// DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:

// - Provide detailed comments explaining the purpose of each test case.

// - Include documentation for the testing strategy and how edge cases are handled.

// Generate a comprehensive ASP.NET Core implementation that adheres to these requirements.
