// You are a world-class .NET architect and C# expert with 50+ years of combined experience, specializing in enterprise-grade development patterns and best practices.
//
// CONTEXT: ASP.NET Core application
//
// REQUIREMENTS:
// Functional: Implement .NET Web API with PostgreSQL and Entity Framework
// Non-Functional: Production-ready code with proper error handling, validation, and edge case handling
//
// ARCHITECTURE: Follow Clean Architecture with Controllers, Services, and Repository patterns
//
// TESTING: Include comprehensive test coverage with proper mocking and error case validation. Ensure **100% test coverage** for all methods, including:
// - Positive scenarios (e.g., successful CRUD operations).
// - Negative scenarios (e.g., invalid inputs, missing data, exceptions).
// - Edge cases (e.g., boundary conditions, empty collections, null values).
// - Ensure all branches, conditions, and paths in the code are tested.
// - Write tests for all layers (Controller, Service, Repository) and their interactions.
// - Include integration tests for end-to-end validation of API behavior.
//
// FRAMEWORKS: MSTest, ASP.NET Core, AutoMapper
//
// ORIGINALITY REQUIREMENTS:
// - Create UNIQUE implementation with custom business logic specific to [BUSINESS_DOMAIN] domain
// - Use distinctive variable names, method signatures, and class structures for [ENTITY_NAME]
// - Implement domain-specific validation rules and custom business constraints for [FEATURE_NAME]
// - Add unique error handling patterns with [COMPANY_NAME]-specific error codes and messages
// - Include original comments explaining [PROJECT_NAME] business context and implementation decisions
// - Avoid generic boilerplate patterns - create contextual, [BUSINESS_DOMAIN]-driven code
//
// Generate comprehensive ASP.NET Core implementation that:
// - Follows enterprise patterns and SOLID principles with unique [BUSINESS_DOMAIN] business logic
// - Includes extensive error handling with [COMPANY_NAME]-specific error messages
// - Implements proper logging with contextual [PROJECT_NAME] business information
// - Uses modern C# 12+ and .NET 8+ features in creative ways for [BUSINESS_DOMAIN]
// - Includes **unit tests with 100% test coverage** for all methods, including:
//   - Positive cases (e.g., valid inputs, successful operations).
//   - Negative cases (e.g., invalid inputs, exceptions, missing data).
//   - Edge cases (e.g., boundary conditions, empty collections, null values).
//   - Tests for all branches, conditions, and paths in the code.
//   - Tests for all validation rules and error handling scenarios.
// - Mock all external dependencies (e.g., repositories, external services).
// - Validate error handling and ensure proper exception messages are returned.
// - Use parameterized tests to cover multiple input variations.
// - Ensure test coverage reports are generated to verify completeness and highlight untested code.
//
// DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
// - Provide detailed comments explaining the purpose of each test case.
// - Include documentation for the testing strategy, including how edge cases, error scenarios, and boundary conditions are handled.
// - Include a summary of the test coverage report and highlight how 100% coverage was achieved.
//
// Generate a comprehensive ASP.NET Core implementation that adheres to these requirements.
